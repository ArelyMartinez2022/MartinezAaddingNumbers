ADDING NUMBERS #2

THIS PROGRAM WILL ASK THE USER FOR 2 NUMBERS 
ONCE THE USER ENTERS A VAILD 1ST NUMBER IT 
WILL DO THE SAME FOR THE 2ND NUMBER. IF THE 
USER HAPPENS TO TYPE A INAVILD RESPONSE FOR 
EITHER THEY WILL HAVE TO REPLAY UNTIL ITS VAILD.
THE PROGRAM WILL THEN ADD THE TWO NUMBERS AND 
DISPLAY THE ANSWER ON THE TERMIAL 

PEER REVIEW: CARLOS FELIPE -- CODE LOOKS GOOD. I RAN THE PROGRAM AND FOUND NO WAY TO BREAK IT. I LIKE THAT EVERY USER INPUT HAS A CORRECT RESPONSE EVEN IF THE USER IS DUMB AND TRIES TO ADD LETTERS (NOT ME I SWEAR). I ALSO LIKED THAT IT DISPLAYS (FOR EXAMPLE):
4 + 5 = 9 THIS IS GOOD BECAUSE I IMMEDIATELY FORGOT WHAT I INPUTED. OVERALL THE CODE COULD USE SOME OPTIMIZATION BUT WORKS GREAT!
